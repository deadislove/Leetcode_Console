### Most Asked Questions
- A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not
> A binary search tree (BST) is a node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties. 
> The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key. 
>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. 
>Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

> Below are the different methods to remove duplicates in a string.

- Search an element in a sorted and rotated array
> An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search. But suppose we rotate an 
> ascending order sorted array at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. So for instance, 1 2 3 4 5 
> might become 3 4 5 1 2. Devise a way to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time.

> Improved Solution: 
> Approach: 
> Instead of two or more pass of binary search the result can be found in one pass of binary search. The binary search needs to be modified to perform the search. The idea is to create a recursive function that takes l and r as range in input and the key.

- Add two numbers represented by linked lists
> Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns the sum list. The sum list is linked list representation of the addition of two input numbers. It is not allowed to modify the lists. Also, not allowed to use explicit extra space (Hint: Use Recursion).

- Connect nodes at same level
> Write a function to connect all the adjacent nodes at the same level in a binary tree. Structure of the given Binary Tree node is like following.

- Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
> According to the definition of LCA on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): 
> “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
